\section*{Measurement in Data Science}
Measurement plays a critical role in data science, serving as the foundation for insights and policies. It's crucial for data scientists to understand what their dataset captures and does not capture.

\section*{R Programming}


\section*{Python}


\section*{Julia}


\section*{Web Scraping}
Data scientists should be adept at web scraping, leveraging publicly available data from webpages either through APIs or HTML parsing for their analyses.

\section*{Handling Large Data Sets With  Hadoop or Spark}
For data too large for a single machine, solutions like Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) using Hadoop or Spark are essential for distributed data processing.

\section*{SQL}
SQL is highlighted as a fundamental tool for data transformation, enabling easy data subsetting, merging, and other transformations.
